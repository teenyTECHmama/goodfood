        <p align=center> Hello and welcome to my website that is all about my love for food.
                        I am passionate about cooking and love trying new things.
                        You will find many delicious recipes that my loved ones and I can't get enough of.
                        You can find recipes for if you are craving something sweet, salty, or both! 
                        And even some dishes that are so spicy, your mouth might fall off if you are up to the challenge.
                        You can also find some recipes from foods I have enjoyed from different parts of the world. 
                        Enjoy the ride, I hope you are hungry...
        </p>
