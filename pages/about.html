        <p> My name is Maya and  I grew up in sunny San Diego, California.
            As a mixed child of a French mother and Sierra Leonean father, I was exposed 
            to thier favorite foods which soon became mine. Growing up in many of the cities 
            all over San Diego and in the mexican community, the Mexican culture and food has 
            always made me feel at home.
       </p> 
       <p>I left San Diego to move to Nantes, France in 2014. I was able to nurture great
           relationships with family that had been long overdue but when it came to good home cooked 
           meals, I had to be inivative. Now, I live in Paris and have better access to imported ingredients 
           that truly give a meal its authenticity. Over the years, I have had certain recipes that have pleased many 
           locked away. However, I am in a sharing mood and I know for a fact eeach meal will have your belly full and 
           satisfied.
