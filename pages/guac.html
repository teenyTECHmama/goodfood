        <p> Guacamole is great as a snack with chips or as a side for anything in a tortilla, to be honest. Tortillas are best when heated
            Sometimes when I can't find exactly tortillas, but whatever that equates to it like maybe wraps will do. This is a zesty
            and fresh side. It doeesn't take that long to do, aproximately 15 minutes. All you need is a chopping board, a knife, and a fork. It you have a 
            food processor or blender, it will help with having a smooth and creamy texture. Personally, I like mine kind of chunky.
            I am not very big on percise measuremnts for ingredients, I add ingredient amounts based mainly on taste so I have 
            mentioned ingredient amounts in genreral terms. Do what tastes right to you! After playing with this recipe, you gain better
            confidence with usind avocado in different meals making avodado toast or making avocado fritters and cakes.

        <p> After last semester ended and we were on summer break, I finally had some free time
            to cook up a feast. I made plenty of servings for friends to enjoy and take home
            left overs. As you can see, I served it with a big bowl of chips, because there's never 
            enough chips. You can eat it with chips and other salsas or scoop some guacamole on
            a quesidilla,taco,burrito... and enjoy!
