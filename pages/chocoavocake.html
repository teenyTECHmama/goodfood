    <p> I know what you're thinking... Avocado and chocolate can not be good, at all. But
        don't knock it until your try it. I was vegan a few years ago and foud this intriguing 
        recipe. I have heard of using zucchini or courgette as a substitue for egg but not avocado.
        Avocado is a rather strong taste to try to mask with sweetness. I was up for the challenge
        and this recipe is a secret weapon. Every time I reveal that I made this super
        chocolatey cake with just 3 avocados, no one ever believe me!

    <p> I made this cake for a Thanksgiving pot luck at my university, I doubted there
        would a variety of option for people who are vegan. I made a little not specifying
        that it was vegan. That cake was devoured in less that 10 minutes and none of the people
        who were vegan were able to try it. It was so good people couldn not taste the avocado.
        I made the cake again for another potluck but didn't teell anyone what I made it with.
        After everyone finished their slices without a single crumb left, I told them they just
        a vegan cake made with avocados and they were stunned. Youcan decide how sweet you 
        want to make. I add some maple syrup sometimes(one of my secret ingredients). This cake always amazes people of how good it is. You can 
        experiment with the topping, I tried crused oreos one year and and oreo pie crust I found at the 
        market.I personally call these cakes <em>Death by chocolate</em> because it is so chocolate and fudgy.
        This cake is truly unforgettable.
