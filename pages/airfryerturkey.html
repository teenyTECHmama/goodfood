        <p> Air-fryers are becoming more and more popular. Last year we tried to
            cook the turkey in it. The turkey had to be cut into portions to fit
            in our lttle air fryer but. it was so. worth it. Guests that came 
            last Thanksgiving are begging for that delicious turkey.

        <p> This dish takes less than an hour and a half and because the turkey is cooked in the
            air-fryer, and is cooked breast side down for most of the time, you will get an incredible juicy bird. The 
            brine can be alterned to incorporate whatever you wish. I think we didn't even marinate our turkey that longer
            and it still came out super juicy. Just look at that turkey and tell me it doesn't look good! I couldn't eat
            it since I am a vegetarian but even I knew it was a game changer. It can be eaten with whatever sides you like. I 
            wanted to add another simple recipe you can whip up in the air-fryer to compliment the turkey. Last years guests 
            dream of that turkey to this day, but no worries becaue Thanksgiving is coming up!
